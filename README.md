* In my latest project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the supply chain using Python, leveraging key libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for basic plotting, Seaborn for enhanced visualization, and Plotly for interactive visualizations. The study provides valuable insights into the supply chain dynamics, presenting a clear and visually appealing representation of the data. This approach not only ensures a thorough examination of the supply chain but also facilitates effective communication of findings through intuitive and insightful visualizations
